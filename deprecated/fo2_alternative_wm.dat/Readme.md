Fallout 2 Alternative Worldmap
------------------

The FALLOUT 2 worldmap has various terrain tiles set as "city", which are impossible to recognize for players. With this mod enabled, those tiles have actual visible city ruins on them.
I have used .Pixotes. modified Fo2 worldmap as base.

This mod is compatible with Fo2 vanilla, the unofficial patch, and the restoration project. For a download link, see the attached file to this post.

I suggest to set the following settings in the ddraw.ini file for a better travel experience when using this mod:

```
ExpandWorldMap=1
WorldMapTravelMarkers=1
TravelMarkerColor=134
TravelMarkerStyles=1:2,2:1,1:2,1:2
WorldMapTerrainInfo=1
```
### Installation
To use this mod, copy the "fo2_alternative_wm.dat" folder into the "/fallout2/mods/" folder and the game will automatically load it.
