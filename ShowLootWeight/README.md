Show Loot Weight
----------------

This mod adds a lightweight current/max carry weight indicator to the looting and stealing interface.

This mod is compatible with any FALLOUT 2 mod as long as it uses the latest Sfall release. However, it should not be used in combination with the Inventory Filter mod as it offers a similar feature and more.

### Installation
To use this mod, add the mod folder name to the mods_order.txt file inside the /mods/ directory. If the mods_order.txt doesn't exist, start the game once for it to be created.
